## Fantasy Book App


##The problem
Finding a great fantasy book can be tough, especially when you have so little time to invest in reading. Readers can't afford to waste time reading mediocre novels. Thats where Fantasy Book Alley comes in. We take the pulse of fantasy book lovers and curate the best lists from multiple trusted sources for great recommendations and present it to users in a accessible interface.



##Technology
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) for instant prototyping getting it into the hands of readers ASAP.

It uses lists from BestFantasyBook, FantasyBookCritic and reddit/r/fantasy.
